# Oscillator and Amplifier Circuit

## Overview
This project implements an oscillator and amplifier circuit composed of multiple transistor stages, powered by a 40 V supply. The design utilizes both NPN and PNP transistors to achieve signal generation, amplification, and load adaptation. The documentation details the circuit components, their roles, and the step-by-step operation of the system.

## Features
1. **Signal Generation**: A Wien oscillator generates rectangular oscillations, which are converted into a triangular signal through capacitors.  
2. **Amplification**: Transistor-based NPN and PNP amplifier stages provide voltage and current amplification for the triangular signal.  
3. **Output Stage**: A Class B output stage delivers sufficient current for the load, ensuring efficient impedance matching.  

This circuit demonstrates a modular and efficient design approach for generating and amplifying triangular wave signals with practical applications in signal processing and electronics experimentation.
